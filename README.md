# Architecture
In my full stack project, I worked with two types of frontend development: Express HTML with JavaScript and a Single-Page Application (SPA) using Angular. Express HTML focuses on server-side rendering, where the server delivers complete HTML pages for each request. It is simple but reloads the entire page for updates. On the other hand, Angular SPA uses client-side rendering, where only dynamic content is updated without a full page reload, leading to faster and smoother user interactions. The SPA structure uses components, services, and models, making it more organized and efficient.
The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database because it is flexible and scalable. MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, which are ideal for handling unstructured or semi-structured data. This structure is perfect for applications with changing requirements and integrates with JavaScript-based frameworks like Angular and Node.js.
# Functionality
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data format used for communication between the frontend and backend. While JavaScript is a programming language that can manipulate data, JSON only represents structured data. JSON ties the frontend and backend together by serving as the format for data exchange. For example, when the frontend sends an HTTP request to the backend, the backend responds with JSON data that is parsed and displayed on the client side.
During the development process, I refactored code to improve efficiency and functionality. For instance, I consolidated repeated API calls into reusable Angular services, reducing redundancy and making the code cleaner. I also created reusable user interface components, such as forms and buttons, which made it easier to maintain consistency across the app while saving time during development.
# Testing
For testing, API endpoints were tested using tools like Postman to ensure proper data retrieval (GET requests) and manipulation (PUT requests). Security layers added complexities, requiring attention to authentication and authorization during API testing to ensure only authorized users can access specific data.
# Reflection
This course has been instrumental in helping me reach my professional goals by giving me hands-on experience with full stack development. I have learned to build scalable web applications using the MEAN stack, RESTful API design, and frontend and backend integration. Additionally, I developed skills in testing and debugging web applications. With all these technical skills combined, this experience made me a more marketable candidate in the tech industry.
